# SmartOutreach Tracking System

SmartOutreach is a modern web application designed to help organizations track, manage, and empower outreach workers in the field. With real-time check-in/check-out and location tracking, it's built for teams on-the-go.

## What Makes SmartOutreach Unique?

- **FastAPI-Powered Backend:**  
  The system integrates FastAPI for high-performance background tasks, data processing, and real-time event handling. This gives outreach organizations modern speed and scalability, and supports future AI-driven enhancements.

- **Field Worker Focused:**  
  Specifically designed for outreach (rural, health, education, etc.) teams who operate outside traditional offices. It supports check-in/check-out, live location updates, and device-based security.

- **Privacy & Security:**  
  Staff location is only tracked when checked in, respecting user privacy. Device locking (IMEI support) ensures only authorized logins.

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Masters and developers have access to a dashboard with statistics, logs, and management tools.

- **Automatic Data Cleanup:**  
  Set up scheduled scripts to keep location logs fresh and accurate.
